# test-writing-practice

<h1>Overview</h1>

- <b>Tests</b> are located in `tests/tests.test.js`
- <b>Functions</b> are located in `functions.js`

<p>Because my main goal is to learn through test writing, the functions themselves are quite minimal. (I.E., I'm not trying to write a method that does what <code>parseInt()</code> does without actually using <code>parseInt()</code>, but let me know if this not the most helpful approach.</p>
